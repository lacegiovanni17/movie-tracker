# MOVIE TRACKER
## MOVIE TRACKER FULLSTACK AI PROMPTED PROJECT
This 🎬 Movie Tracker project is a full-stack application built using ReactJS for the frontend and C# .NET MVC for the backend, with MongoDB 🛢️ as the database to persist user data. It allows users to add movies with a title and optional notes, mark them as watched or unwatched, and rate them ⭐. The project was designed with prompt engineering via RooCode AI 🤖, enabling rapid scaffolding and automation of common tasks, boosting development speed and consistency. ReactJS was chosen for its responsive UI and component-based architecture, ideal for rendering dynamic movie lists. On the backend, C# .NET MVC provides a robust and scalable API framework, ensuring structured routing and controller logic. MongoDB supports flexible data storage, perfect for managing user-generated content without strict schema constraints. All RESTful endpoints were tested using Postman 📬 to ensure smooth communication between client and server. This project showcases a seamless integration of technologies and development practices to deliver a feature-rich, user-friendly movie tracking system.

1. I downloaded RooCode AI extension into my VSCode and put in the settings as shown in the picture above and it connected successfully. 
2. After successfull connection, I then passed in necessary prompts to the RooCode code and run the commands which was used to create both frontend and backend section of my movie tracker app
3. I created my MongoDB Database and connected it to the Backend
4. I tested out my backend endpoints
5. I used the RooCode AI prompting to create the Frontend section with ReactJS and Typescript and TailwindCSS
6. Tested Connection of Frontend to Backend
